1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. It makes it seamless in regards to creating a reactive app. Basically there isn't the downtime with user interaction that there is with plain javascript only. React updates and renders when data changes. 

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

It means having one job per component. It requires mapping out your app and taking it one section at a time.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class components can have state making them useful when a lot of data or data that is expected to change is involved. Functional components are more like simple javascript functions that accept props, which are good for when data is not expected to change.

4.  Describe state.

State stores permanant attributes inside a component that you can access inside of the component. You can change the attributes using setState making state mutable.

5.  Describe props.

props are passed to a component, helping to make components reusable. Props are immutable.
